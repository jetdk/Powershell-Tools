<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Detects circular nesting issues among security groups in Active Directory.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script retrieves all security groups (with their 'member' attribute), builds a lookup 
    of group-to-group membership relationships (only considering group objects), and then 
    uses a recursive depth-first search to detect cycles in the nested groups. When a cycle is 
    found, it prints out the cycle and a recommendation to break the cycle.

.NOTES
    - This script requires the ActiveDirectory module. In PowerShell 7, you might need to use 
      Windows compatibility if not running on Windows.
    - Test carefully when processing ~67,000 groups.
