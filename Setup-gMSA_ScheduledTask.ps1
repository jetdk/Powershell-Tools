.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a gMSA in Active Directory and sets up a Scheduled Task that runs a PowerShell 7 script under the gMSA.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script will:
      1. Check for and import the ActiveDirectory module.
      2. Create (or verify the existence of) a gMSA in AD.
      3. Install the gMSA locally.
      4. Prompt for scheduled task details (including trigger info and the task owner).
      5. Create a scheduled task that runs a PowerShell 7 script under the gMSA.
      6. Embed owner details in the task's RegistrationInfo (documentation for who set it up).

.NOTES
    - Run this script in an elevated PowerShell 7 session.
    - Ensure RSAT tools (and the ActiveDirectory module) are installed.
    - This script assumes Windows 10/Server 2016 or later (for the RegistrationInfo feature).
